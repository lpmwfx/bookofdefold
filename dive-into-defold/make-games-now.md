# Make Games Now!

The **Dive into Defold** section will guide you through making several full games using Defold. You do not need to read any other section first before you begin this section. You must **follow along** and not simply read. By following along, you will be able to learn more quickly and remember what you've read long term.

You will need to download Defold first and make sure it runs. Defold has an auto-update feature so you can easily get up to date from any other version.
