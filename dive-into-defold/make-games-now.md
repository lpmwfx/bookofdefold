# Make Games Now!

The **Dive into Defold** section will guide you through making several full games using Defold. You do not need to read any other section first before you begin this section. You must **follow along** and not simply read. By following along, you will be able to learn more quickly and remember what you've read long term.

**Notice:** Currently examples are being put up. Later on step by step tutorials will be put up for each example. You can still learn valuable insights by reading the source of examples.

You will need to download Defold first and make sure it runs. Defold has an auto-update feature so you can easily get up to date from any other version.
