# Editor Tour

## Splash

When you first launch Defold you will see a splash screen as the editor loads. Images of games made with Defold are periodically showcased here. Maybe one day your game will be!

## Launcher

![The editor launcher gives you a long list of recent projects to pick from. Convenient!](../.gitbook/assets/launcher-2018-07-20-08_19_35.png)

After the splash, you will see the launcher. Here you can open one of your recent projects, open any project from your computer, create a new project based on a template, and import from your Defold dashboard in the cloud.

When creating a new project from the launcher, you can pick from various templates or starter projects either based on official tutorials or samples.

To import projects from the Defold cloud you must have created an account on Defold.com and created a project on your dashboard there. Using the Defold cloud is not required to make games with Defold. You can easily use your own Git hosting for your projects.
